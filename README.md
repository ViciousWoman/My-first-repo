# My-first-repo
In this project ive used the source code from the vodeo at CodeInstitute.
i was sloppy and delited the code i did my self when i thought i would not need it annymore.
so i decided to be sloppy as this is just a challange and not the full project.
## Technologies used!
here we use some HTML5 and CSS3 i belive aswell as python3 to open the preview server and git to add, commit and push files to github.
i might be wrong so dont take my word for it. i am verry new to this still.
